<h1>Lucy's All Time Favourite Films</h>
<h2>A list exploring my favourite films I've watched over the last few years</h2>

<li>
<h3>Nimona</h3>
<p>The first time that I watched this film it made me sob. Our epynomous protagonist, Nimona, joins forces with a Knight of the Kingdom who has fallen from grace after being set 
up by the Instituition. Together they relearn the values of trust and friendship as well as not judging people right off the bat.</p>
<p>Very badly described but a 10 out of 10, loved it.</p>

<h3>How To Train Your Dragon</h3>
<p>I love all three of the How To Train Your Dragon Films. I think I have probably cried during all three of them. They also have a beautiful soundtrack by John Powell.</p>
<p>Another 10 out of 10, this whole list will basically comprise of tens.</p>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Studio Ghibli films will always have a place in my heart for the 
beautiful artwork and animation.</p>
